# Project Laika üåç

**Project Laika** is an interactive, AI-driven web application developed for NASA's Space Apps Challenge 2024. Designed under the **"Tell Us a Climate Story"** challenge, this application uses real-time data to tell engaging and fictionalized climate stories about various regions on Earth. Users can explore an interactive Earth model, click on a region, and reveal a story inspired by climate data, illustrating the impact of climate change on the flora, fauna, and environment in that area.

## üåü Features

- **Interactive 3D Earth Model**: Users are greeted with a 3D model of Earth. Clicking on a region brings up a unique, story-driven experience inspired by climate data.
- **AI-Generated Climate Stories**: Stories are crafted based on data from various APIs, presenting the local climate's impact on animals, plants, and humans in a vivid, narrative style.
- **Dynamic Data Integration**: Using APIs like OpenWeather and GBIF, the application brings real-time environmental data into each story, adding authenticity and depth to the fictional tales.

## üìö Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with 3D rendering powered by Three.js and react-three-fiber.
- **Backend**: Next.js for API handling and data integration.
- **AI Models**: Eleven Labs for voice synthesis and Gemini models via Google Cloud's Vertex AI for story generation.
- **Hosting**: Vercel, for seamless and rapid deployment.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Explore the Earth**: The interactive Earth model is the entry point. Users click on different regions, each linked to a unique story.
2. **Data-Driven Stories**: Behind the scenes, the application calls multiple APIs to gather real-time climate and biodiversity data. This information feeds into an AI model, which generates a fictional narrative depicting the local climate's impact.
3. **Engaging Narratives**: Each story provides an immersive experience, blending factual climate insights with fictional elements that personify the environmental changes in each area.

## üìà Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Data Visualizations**: Introduce animations that visually represent climate data trends, such as temperature changes, precipitation levels, or biodiversity shifts over time. This will allow users to gain a more dynamic understanding of the climate impact through visual storytelling.

- **Regional Photos**: Display real images of the area clicked, providing users with visual context and a closer connection to each story. These images could include landscapes, local flora and fauna, or any significant geographical features to enrich the narrative experience.

- **Zoom and Pan Features**: Add zoom and pan capabilities to the Earth model, allowing users to focus on specific regions and get a closer look at areas of interest. This feature would make exploring the 3D model more interactive and allow for detailed inspection of each story's geographic context.

- **Audio Narration for Stories**: Enable audio playback for each story, utilizing Eleven Labs for realistic, AI-generated narration, providing users with an immersive auditory experience as they explore.

- **User-Driven Story Customization**: Allow users to adjust narrative elements, like choosing the type of character (e.g., plant, animal, or human) featured in the story, making each interaction more personalized and engaging.
